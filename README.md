# Quantium-Trial-Impact-Store-Level-Performance-Analysis
This project analyzes the impact of a retail trial conducted across three selected stores by Quantium. Using pre-trial metrics, control stores were identified based on similarity in performance. The trial's effectiveness was then assessed through statistical analysis and visualizations of sales and customer trends.
